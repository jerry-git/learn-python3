# Learn Python 3

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jerry-git/learn-python3.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jerry-git/learn-python3)

## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of materials for teaching/learning Python 3 (3.5+).

#### Requirements
* Have Python 3.5 or newer installed. You can check the version by typing `python3 --version` in your command line. You can download the latest Python version from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* Have [Jupyter Notebook installed](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).

If you can not access Python and/or Jupyter Notebook on your machine, you can still follow the web based materials. However, you should be able to use Jupyter Notebook in order to complete the exercises.

#### Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Run `jupyter notebook` command in your command line in the repository directory.
3. Jupyter Notebook session will open in your browser and you can start navigating through the materials.

## Intermediate

#### Idiomatic Python
Python is a powerfull language which contains many language features that are not present in most of the other languages. Idiomatic section will cover some of these Pythonic features in detail. This material could be especially useful for people who have backgound with other programming languages.

1. [Idiomatic loops](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/jerry-git/learn-python3/blob/master/notebooks/intermediate/html/idiomatic_loops.html) [[notebook]](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jerry-git/learn-python3/blob/master/notebooks/intermediate/idiomatic_loops.ipynb)
